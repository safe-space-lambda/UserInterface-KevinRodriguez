Topics:

* Using Html and CSS syntax in order to create a basic design for an app

* Using JS in order add any information that was necessary to the app

For this project, our team wanted to create an app which took the texts from users and return said text every day.

## Description

### Part Uno

* In order to create the website the UI team envisioned a page which was both inviting and practical in its use. 
Therefore we needed to design a website which saw that the user had access to a lot of knowledge about the app straight off the bat.

* Basic HTML and CSS is necessary for the design of this site as well as use of flexbox and block displays.

* The use of LESS was implemented for this project in order to manipulate the CSS. Various LESS files were created for different portions of the project in order
for the code to be easier to read and more concise. For example, the header portion of the html had it's styling manipulated by the header.less file. Elements
which were used for the most part for every single part of the page is located in the global.less file. 


### Part Dos

* The JS needed for the app requires a knowledge of all the basic functions and the use of arrays and their manipulations. 

* Use of constructors and DOM events are to be used in order to activate and manipulate the tabs.
